# Active Transportation Functional Plan 2014 cheatsheet

## walking

1. Halifax should develop a comprehensive strategy to address the gaps in the
pedestrian network, especially on major roadways (collectors and arterials) served by transit in the urban
areas. To achieve this, consideration should be given to creating a new strategic pedestrian budget to
address gaps on major roads.
2. Where a sidewalk is needed on a busy road in the urban areas, and a bike route
is also desired according to Maps 2A, B & C, consideration should be given to building an AT greenway
beside the road to serve both modes.

3. Halifax should undertake a study to determine if and how new gaps in the
pedestrian network can be avoided by requiring developer contributions to off-site pedestrian
infrastructure through the subdivision process, in the Urban Areas.
4. Halifax should undertake a planning review within the Urban Areas to determine
if there are areas where the costs of maintaining municipal streets to address the needs of pedestrians
would be prohibitive and whether zoning amendments should be considered in those areas.
5. Halifax needs to develop a comprehensive approach to the delivery of rural
active transportation facilities, including criteria for determining the most appropriate AT facility type,
and consideration of the financial implications (capital and operating) of doing so.
6. The municipality should consider the recommendations of the 2014 Crosswalk
Safety Advisory Committee Report in future updates of the Pedestrian Safety Action Plan.
7. Halifax should consider amending the Encroachment By-law (E-200) to provide
stronger protections for a minimum pedestrian clear zone of 2.1m in dense commercial areas.
8. Halifax should consider making it a standard practice to add tactile surface
indicators in concrete curb ramps to assist pedestrians with visual impairments.
9. Halifax should consider incorporating pedestrian friendly street design
guidelines during any review of the Red Book and in the development of a Complete Streets Policy.
10. Halifax should consider a pilot program to implement walkability improvements
in the street network.
11. To encourage AT walking, new communities in the municipality should be
designed to be compact and mixed use, offering a wide range of live/work/shop/play opportunities
within walking distance of each other.
12. Halifax should consider MPS and LUB amendments that support the retrofitting
of existing communities to create walkable characteristics (i.e. mixed land use) where they did not
previously exist.
13. Consideration should be given when locating new municipal facilities (e.g.
recreation centres, libraries, office buildings, etc.) that they be located in walkable areas. The
municipality should also encourage other levels of government to consider walkability when locating
their facilities.
14. The municipality should engage with the Halifax Regional School Board to
encourage the siting of schools in a manner that will encourage active travel to school.
15. Halifax should consider MPS and LUB amendments in the urban areas to require
street–oriented commercial buildings and/ or direct, separated, pedestrian connection(s) from the right
of way to the main entrance of all office, retail, and institutional buildings, whether there is an existing
sidewalk in the right of way or not.

## cycling

### outputs

$6.5M over 5 years. 

by 2019:

- 15 km of Local Street Bikeways in the Regional Centre;
- 5 km of bicycle lanes in the Regional Centre;
- 2 km of greenways in the Regional Centre;
- One pilot project of a protected bicycle lane;
- Improved connections to the Macdonald Bridge Bikeway on both sides;
- 10 km of Local Street Bikeways outside Regional Centre;
- 12 km of bike lanes and/ or paved shoulders outside the Regional Centre.

Recommendation #16: Focus the AT Plan bicycle program on making connections to create a network.
Recommendation #17: The municipality should consider protected bicycle lanes where ever there are
candidate bicycle routes on Maps 2A, B, & C, and aim to implement at least one protected bicycle lane
pilot project in the next five years.
Recommendation #18: The municipality should consider the adoption of a policy to enable the
implementation of Local Street Bikeways where shown on Maps 2 A, B, and C, including consistent
signage to identify this type of facility.
Recommendation #19: The municipality should continue to explore solutions to improving connections
of the Macdonald Bridge Bikeway on both sides of the bridge, and aim to implement a solution on the
Halifax side concurrent with the end of the re-decking project.
Recommendation #20: To achieve the goal of doubling of AT mode share, the municipality needs to
focus AT plan implementation for cycling on the types of infrastructure preferred by new bicyclists.
Recommendation #21: Where a bike route is desired (Maps 2A, B & C) and pedestrian facilities are also
needed, consideration should be given to building an AT Greenway beside the road to serve both modes.
Recommendation #22: To achieve the goal of doubling of AT mode share, the municipality should put
particular emphasis on the Regional Centre for the cycling component of implementing the AT Plan.
23. Maps 2B & C identify streets that Council has confirmed as candidate routes for
bicycle lanes in the Regional Centre. Prior to establishing these painted (or protected) bicycle lanes there
should be:
- More detailed review of each corridor under criteria listed in Appendix E;
- Public engagement; and
- Regional Council approval.
24. Along streets identified as candidate routes for bicycle lanes on Maps 2B and 2C,
new developments should reduce reliance on on-street parking by providing sufficient off-street parking
for their own uses, including visitor parking. New and existing developments may also be required to
consider loading from alternate streets, or time-limited periods for loading. Land Use Bylaw
amendments should be considered to ensure these matters are considered by property owners.
25. Bicycle facility development in urban areas outside the regional centre should
focus on:

- Improved connections to local destinations, such as schools, recreation centres, libraries, retail centres and transit hubs.
- Completion of the greenway network as per Section 7 of this plan
- New bicycle lanes and local street bikeways where identified on Maps 2A, B, and C.

26. The municipality should work with rural communities and the Province to
identify good candidate routes for paved shoulders that provide AT connections to local destinations.
Halifax should also work with the Province and Bicycle Nova Scotia to identify preferred routes through
the municipality to be followed by the Nova Scotia Blue Route. Council should consider amendments to
Maps 2A, B, and C as needed, resulting from this process.
27. The municipality needs to review maintenance service standards for bicycle
lanes and routes, and should consider adopting special standards, especially on the busiest bike routes.
28. Council should continue to support cycling through the supply and installation of
bicycle racks and repair stands and should consider a pilot program to support the installation of more
bicycle parking at commercial locations and schools which predated the 2006 Land Use Bylaw bicycle
parking requirements.
29. The municipality should work with the province to enable bicycle traffic control
signage, signals and pavement markings approved for use by the Transportation Association of Canada
to be used under the Nova Scotia Motor Vehicle Act and Regulations, and should consider testing
innovations in active transportation facilities under the Innovative Transportation Act.
30. The municipality should work towards improved detection of bicycles at
signalized intersections and undertake to replace existing detection technologies with ones sensitive to
bicycles when intersections or signals are upgraded. Consideration should also be given to marking the
pavement with a stencil to advise cyclists of correct positioning on the roadway to activate the signal.

## multi-use

$ 17M over 5 years

Outputs to 2019
 15 new km of new greenways (multi-use trails);
 13 km of existing greenways upgraded (widened and/ or paved);
 Five new pedestrian/ bicycle bridges (or at grade crossings of AT barriers like railway tracks);
 Five functional design plans to inform future projects.

Recommendation #31: The municipality should focus on making connections in the greenway network
in general, and specifically tackling those connections into and through the regional centre. Halifax
should also continue to improve connections between existing communities and nearby greenways.
Recommendation #32: The municipality should continue to support the Community Development Model
for the development of greenways. This may be especially critical for the development of long distance
greenways where community oversight may be essential to long term sustainability. Due to the
increased complexities of urban greenway development the Community Development Model may not
always be used, or may only be employed during the public engagement and planning stages.
Recommendation #33: The municipality should continue to seek opportunities to leverage funding from
other sources to build the greenway network.
Recommendation #34: At least for the next five years of AT Plan implementation, consideration should
be given to prioritizing funds from the Active Transportation and Regional Trails budgets towards
greenways with a transportation focus (i.e. those that support walking and bicycling and connect origins
with destinations).
Recommendation #35: Consider MPS, LUB, and Red Book amendments to protect the continuity of the
greenway network, facilitate the construction of new greenways along with land development, and
ensure new communities are connected to existing greenways.
Recommendation #36: When carrying out any capital works, reviewing new subdivisions, or
negotiating development agreements, municipal staff should give consideration to this AT Priorities Plan
and seek to fill gaps in the envisioned greenway network (through means available to them) and also
provide good connections to it from adjacent communities.
Recommendation #37: The municipality should consider the development of a consistent and uniform
AT wayfinding and route identification system for greenways which is integrated with the signage
proposed for Local Street Bikeways.
Recommendation #38: Halifax should consider building AT Bridges or crossings to overcome barriers in
the AT network particularly between high density residential areas and business/ commercial areas.
Areas where such connections are absent include, but are not limited to:




Between Olivet Street apartments and West End Mall (needs at-grade railway crossing);
Between Chisholm Ave. apartments and Bayers Centre (AT bridge over the CN rail cut);
Over CN rail cut at Saint Mary’s University (a link in the Halifax Urban Greenway);
At least one more pedestrian/ bicycle crossing of a 100 series highway.
Recommendation #39: The municipality should continue to improve pedestrian and bicycle connections
to its transit service.

## maint

## programming

Recommendation #40: The municipality should continue to promote traffic safety for all users and
continue to collaborate with other organizations or levels of government to get the message out.
Recommendation #41: The municipality should evaluate the current approach to AT safety promotion
and skills training and continue to supply education, promotion, and events related to active
transportation. Halifax should continue to collaborate with and support such initiatives which are
implemented by outside groups.

## eval

goals:

1. Establish a complete, integrated and readily accessible region-wide AT network serving urban,
suburban and rural areas;
2. Double the number of person-trips using AT modes by 2026; and,
3. Make conditions for AT modes safer through the development of appropriate facilities in
combination with promotion and safety education.

targets for objective #1:

20 km of new sidewalk as part of the regular sidewalk program;
3 km new sidewalk from new arterial/collector sidewalk program;
Develop a rural pedestrian program to address key gaps,
particularly in designated growth areas;
 Implement three “walkability” improvement projects;
 Improve accessibility at up to 10 intersections through curb cut
changes, tactile markings and accessible pedestrian signals;
 15 km of greenway built;
 10 km of existing greenway upgraded;
 Five new AT bridges or at-grade crossings of AT barriers;
 Five planning processes to inform future projects;
 15 km of Local Street Bikeway installed in Regional Centre;
 5 km of bike lanes installed in Regional Centre (at least one of
which is a protected bicycle lane);
 Improved connections to the Macdonald Bridge Bikeway;
 10 km of Local Street Bikeway outside Regional Centre;
 12 km of bike lanes and other on-road bike facilities (e.g. paved
shoulder) outside the Regional Centre;
Support facilities:
 250 bike racks;
 Up to 100 catch basins replaced;
 10 intersections have bike detection added;
 250 bike racks added in co-operation with private land-owners;
- Facility Connection Maximization .

monitoring of mode-share:

Regional Centre Screenline Count (biannual). This counts every person entering and leaving the
Regional Centre (peninsular Halifax and Dartmouth within the Circumferential Highway) by
mode of transportation at 13 locations.
 Penninsula Screenline Bicycle Count (biannual). Recognizing that the Regional Centre
Screenline Count was completely missing bicycle trips made within the Regional Centre, and
large numbers of cycling trips were made within the peninsula, this count was initiated in 2010
to fill this gap in data. The count captures AM and PM peak bicycle trips crossing an imaginary
line which bisects the peninsula along Quinpool and Cogswell Streets. It is not intended to
capture every trip, but rather to help monitor trends in bicycle use for commuting. Pedestrian
flows within the peninsula are not captured in this count and likely could be.
 Other pedestrian/ bicycle counts are carried out in connection with the installation of new
facilities. This will involve baseline measurements before facility implementation, followed by
regular monitoring in subsequent years to determine modal share impact.
 There should be at least one pilot project of real-time monitoring of cycling volumes.
 From time to time, as required, counts. For example as part of the assessment for a new
crosswalk, pedestrian signal, bike lane, or intersection upgrade. These have traditionally been
carried out manually and would be taken as ‘snapshots’ (i.e. peak hour only, or one day only)
due to the resources required. The municipality has recently acquired new video based
counting equipment which will allow for easier collection of AT user volumes over longer time
periods, when required, and when budgets allow.
 Trail Counts. User counts have been carried out on some local greenways, and the Halifax
Regional Trails Association (HRTA) has recently initiated a trail monitoring program. The
program was piloted in the summer of 2013 with the intent of being set up to regularly monitor
use of AT greenways by pedestrians and cyclists.

## definitions

As-of-Right Development:
An as-of-right development is one that complies with all applicable
zoning regulations and does not require any discretionary action by Regional Council.
AT Greenway: A multi-use trail suitable for the broadest range of AT users (walkers, cyclists,
skateboarders, inline skaters, etc.). They are typically 3.0m wide, or more where higher user volumes
are expected. The surface may be paved or crusher dust, but a paved surface is required if winter
maintenance is expected. These trails form the primary spine of the regional, off-road, AT network.
Accessible Pedestrian Signal (APS):
A device that communicates information about the WALK and
DON’T WALK intervals at signalized intersections in non-visual formats to pedestrians who are blind or
have low vision.
Bicycle Lane: A designated lane on the roadway for bicycles marked with a white painted line and
associated regulatory signage, typically 1.5m wide.
Complete Streets:
An approach to planning, design, operations and maintenance of roadways to
enable safe, convenient and comfortable travel and access for users of all ages and abilities regardless of
their mode of transportation.
Community Development Model:
A model of service delivery where municipal staff works very
closely with community groups towards the planning, construction and maintenance of infrastructure.
Crosswalk:
A place where pedestrians have the right of way when crossing the road. The NS Motor
Vehicle Act indicates that there is a legal crosswalk at every intersection, regardless of whether it is
marked with paint or signs.
Cycle-Track:
See “protected bike lane”
Development Agreement:
Is a contract between the municipality and a developer containing the
development regulations for specific parcel(s) of land as per section 242 (1) of the Halifax Regional
Municipality Charter.
Halifax/HRM: Halifax Regional Municipality is the legal name of this entity; however a recent branding
exercise has resulted in the decision to move forward in referring to the region simply as ‘Halifax’. The
term HRM is still used occasionally in this document for various reasons.
HRM Red Book: Also known as the Municipal Service System Guideline, these engineering design
guidelines for municipal infrastructure (http://www.halifax.ca/designcon/design/munservices.php )
were developed to provide consistency in design and construction issues among developers, consultants
and contractors across the municipality.
Local Street Bikeways: are low speed, low volume streets that have been optimized for bicycle through
traffic. They typically include a mix of traffic calming and bicycle priority measures to minimize traffic
volumes and speeds and create a comfortable cycling environment suited to a wide range of users.
Signs and pavement markings designate the route and convenient bicycle crossings of busier streets are
provided if possible.

Motor Vehicle Act (MVA):
This is the provincial legislation that governs road safety in Nova Scotia
(http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/motor%20vehicle.pdf ).
On Road/ Off Road AT Facilities:
On road facilities for AT include facilities which are typically
located inside the road right of way (i.e. sidewalks for pedestrians; bicycle lanes, wide outside lanes, and
paved shoulders for bicyclists). Off road facilities include those which are typically outside a road right
of way such as AT greenways and other types of trails, paths, and connections.
Paved Shoulder: On roads with a rural cross section (i.e. ditch instead of curb & gutter), a paved area
outside the edge line of the main travelled portion of the roadway.
Pedestrian Clear Zone:
permanent obstructions
An area intended for pedestrian travel which is free of temporary or
Protected Bike Lane: This is an exclusive bicycle facility that is physically separated from motor traffic
and also distinct from the sidewalk. Methods of separation vary and may include curbs, bollards,
planters, rows of parked vehicles, or any other type of physical barrier. These are also known as “cycle
tracks” or “separated bike lanes” in other places.
RA-5: Overhead illuminated pedestrian crosswalk signs used in certain circumstances to supplement
the basic marked crosswalk installation.
Regional Centre:
This is an area defined in the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy as peninsular
Halifax and Dartmouth within the Circumferencial Highway.
Right Of Way (HRM): The HRM right-of-way refers to the strip of land on which roadways are built.
Sidewalks and bike lanes are typically located within the right of way too.
Rural Areas: Areas outside those designated “Urban Settlement” and “Urban Reserve” in the Regional
Plan (refer to May #2 of RP+5).
Shared Lane Markings or “sharrows,” are road markings used to indicate a shared lane environment for
bicycles and automobiles. Sharrows reinforce the legitimacy of bicycle traffic on the street and
recommend proper bicyclist positioning. Sharrows are not really a facility type, but they are pavement
markings with a variety of uses to support a complete bikeway network.
Sidewalk:
A space typically alongside a roadway improved for use by pedestrians. Local sidewalks
are typically made from concrete and separated from the roadway by a curb and/ or grassed boulevard.
Traffic Authority:
An individual appointed by Council under Section 86(6) of the Motor Vehicle Act
who is responsible for the regulation and control of traffic within their jurisdiction.
Urban Areas/ Urban Settlement Designation defines those areas where serviced (central water and
wastewater) urban forms of development will occur over the 25-year span of the Regional Plan. This
designation includes the current Urban Service Area, lands intended to be serviced in future, the
Regional Centre, and Halifax Harbour sub-Designations (refer to Map #2 of RP+5).
Wide Outside Lane: A wider outside (or curbside) lane allows a motorist to safely pass a cyclist while
remaining in the same lane and can significantly improve the comfort of cyclists, especially more
experienced riders. Current standard travel lanes in the municipality are 3.5m and lanes 4.0m to 4.5m
are considered wide.
Zebra Crossing: A crosswalk marking consisting of an alternating series of 600 mm wide white lines and
600 mm spaces placed across a road and aligned parallel to the travel lanes.
