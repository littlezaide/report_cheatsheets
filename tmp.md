## gulf shore highway

[from Confederation Centre exhibition:](http://www.confederationcentre.com/en/exhibitions-archive-read-more.php?exhibition=43)

Robinsons Island, a five-kilometre ribbon of land in the very centre of the proposed park, initially escaped attention, hiding in plain sight between the mass tourism potential of Cavendish to the west and the upmarket promise of Dalvay to the east. Other than calling it "Rustico Island," presumably to free it of any association to past land use, the new park left the island alone.

In the 1950s, Parks Canada dreamed of a scenic highway running the entire length of the park. Robinsons Island was to be the linchpin, its two ends joined to the mainland. There was an ulterior motive for this plan: it was hoped that building a causeway across Little Harbour on Robinsons Island's east end would increase the tidal flow through North Rustico Harbour to the west, scouring it and making it deeper and safer for fishermen landing there. In the 1958 photo, a swath of roadway has been cut through the island's centre and, although it is difficult to see, Little Harbour has been filled in.

But the unforeseen happened: nature sought its own path. With Little Harbour closing off Robinsons Island's east side, the redirected tides ate away at the island's sandy west side. Even as the 1968 and 1974 photographs illustrate the park's developmental hopes for the island-the completion of the highway there, the growth of an amoeba-like campground-they also document the erasure of a considerable portion of the island itself. Efforts to bridge to North Rustico were abandoned.
 
 And then the unforeseen happened again. With the province's best-paved highway a dead end, visitor use of Robinsons Island plummeted and the campground eventually closed. The latest photographs capture the thriving growth of vegetation there-not to mention the accumulation of a substitute island off Anglo Rustico. It has taken half a century, but Robinsons Island is regaining some of the wildness it lost after becoming part of the national park.
